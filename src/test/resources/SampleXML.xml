	  <description>Between 6:23 AM and 6:32 AM PST and between 8:11 AM and 8:21 AM PST, customers in the US-EAST-1 Region may have experienced Internet connectivity issues. The root cause of this issue was a loss of power in one of our network peering facilities. Our network is designed to be fully redundant with multiple independent peering facilities in every region. Some customers experienced elevated latency and packet loss while the network rerouted affected traffic to these unaffected network peering facilities. Some packet loss was also observed as we restored traffic to the affected network peering facility. The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally.</description>

Inactive connections are not receiving routes advertised from Direct Connect routers. We are now working to restore service on these Direct Connect connections. The AWS VPN service is operating normally and may be an alternative for some workloads.</description>
